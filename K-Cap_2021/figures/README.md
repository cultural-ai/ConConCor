#figure_4.csv

File [perc_agreement.csv](https://github.com/cultural-ai/K-CAP_2021/blob/7e688839d5bbe8643de17f8ead167b177a48fb9c/agreement/perc_agreement.csv) was used to aggregate the majority options (1,2,3,4, none) by target word and calculate the proportion (%) of every option by target word; options: 1 â€“ 'contentious', 2 - 'non-contentious', 3 - 'I don't know', 4 - 'Bad OCR', none - 'No majority' (replaced with 0). 

NOTE: In the PDF version of the paper, Figure 4 is incorrect. The bars starting with the label 'zimbabwe' and below do not correspond to the labels due to an error in sorting the data. The correct bar chart is [fig4_correct.png](https://github.com/cultural-ai/ConConCor/blob/master/K-Cap_2021/figures/fig4_correct.png). This mistake did not influence the analysis and conclusions.
